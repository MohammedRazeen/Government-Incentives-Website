    <section id="tax-credits">
        <h2>Electric Vehicle Tax Credits or Rebates</h2>
        <p>Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, or incentives to individuals or businesses purchasing electric vehicles. These incentives can significantly reduce the upfront cost of buying an EV and encourage adoption.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="zev-mandates">
        <h2>Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandates</h2>
        <p>Some regions implement ZEV mandates, requiring automakers to produce a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles or face penalties. These mandates stimulate the development and adoption of electric vehicles and promote cleaner transportation options.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="parking-fees">
        <h2>Free or Reduced Parking Fees</h2>
        <p>Cities and municipalities may provide free or discounted parking for electric vehicles to incentivize EV ownership and reduce congestion in urban areas. Access to convenient parking can make EV ownership more attractive for consumers.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="hov-lane-access">
        <h2>High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lane Access</h2>
        <p>In some areas, electric vehicle owners are granted access to High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, even with only one occupant in the vehicle. This privilege can help reduce commute times and incentivize the purchase of electric vehicles.</p>
