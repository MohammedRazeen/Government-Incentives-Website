        <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are automobiles that are powered by electricity stored in rechargeable batteries. They offer several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>Lower operating costs compared to gasoline vehicles, as electricity is often cheaper than gasoline.</li>
            <li>Reduced dependence on fossil fuels, contributing to energy independence and security.</li>
            <li>Regenerative braking systems that capture energy during braking, extending the vehicle's range.</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth operation, providing a more enjoyable driving experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several types of electric vehicles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):</strong> These vehicles run entirely on electricity stored in batteries and produce zero tailpipe emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):</strong> PHEVs have both an electric motor and a gasoline engine. They can operate on electricity from the battery, gasoline, or a combination of both.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs):</strong> HEVs use a gasoline engine and an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency. Unlike PHEVs, they cannot be plugged in to charge the battery; instead, the battery is charged through regenerative braking and the internal combustion engine.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As technology continues to advance and battery costs decline, the popularity of electric vehicles is expected to increase, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable transportation future.</p>
